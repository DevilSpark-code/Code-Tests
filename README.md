# Mini Code-Projects
Code Tests I define it as a *Dump with interesting things.

It is the place where experimenting with programming concepts becomes easily accessible. 
Different topics, languages, but in all of them I will try to have as much information as possible about them. 

Also I like very much the idea that comes in words of `Martin Fowler`:
>Any idiot can write code that a computer can understand. But only a good programmer can write code that humans can understand.
